## Cohesive Networks VNS3 on AWS

This Quick Start helps you deploy a Cohesive Networks VNS3 overlay network on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud in about 15 minutes, following best practices from AWS and Cohesive Networks. Specifically, this environment can help organizations with workloads that fall within the scope of the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). It addresses certain technical requirements in the Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification Rules (45 C.F.R. Parts 160 and 164) under the HIPAA Administrative Simplification Regulations.

The Quick Start includes AWS CloudFormation templates, which automatically configure the Cohesive Networks VNS3 environment. The [security controls reference (Microsoft Excel spreadsheet)](https://fwd.aws/KqyRg) shows how Quick Start architecture decisions, components, and configurations map to HIPAA regulatory requirements.

This Quick Start is for users interested in a generalized method for encrypting all data in motion between Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, connecting AWS virtual private clouds (VPCs) securely to other networks, and securing traffic with firewalling and network function virtualization.
